Every File Explorer is a dynamic tool to browse, edit, view, explore and modify files. It is plugin-based, so you can make your own plugins for it, as well.

<h3>Building</h3>
Open the project in Visual Studio and build it. You may need to set the references to the correct path, as all libraries are included. Afterwards, copy them into the Plugins directory. 

Please unblock the plugins from external sources.

<h3>Provided Plugins</h3>
* 3DS
